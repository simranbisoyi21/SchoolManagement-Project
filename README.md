# School-Management-Project
In particular, this school management system project in Python Django focuses mainly on dealing with student-teacher records. Also, the system displays all the available dues amounts. In addition, the system allows managing attendance records. Evidently, this project is divided into three categories: Student, Teacher, and Admin Panel. In an overview of this web application, a student can simply register and start using it. Initially, this action requires approval from the admin. In fact, he/she has to apply for it. However, each application requires action from the administrator which depends upon their approval or disapproval. After confirmation of a studentâ€™s account, the user can view his/her details, public notice from admin and teachers. Besides, the student can view their own personal attendance record.
